* Where are you from?
* What do you do?
* Do you have previous experience with technology/data?

# Why am I here

What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here


I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
